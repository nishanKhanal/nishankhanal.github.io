Hi, I'm Nishan Khanal â€” a hard working individual aspiring to be a data scientist, passionate about solving real-world problems using AI, and ML. I have a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and programming, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques.

I like automating stuffs, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. It can be as simple as a cron job to login to a website and click a button to extend my validity period for a free trial - being frugal, or building a data pipeline to automate the process of collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data. I am also interested in teaching and sharing my knowledge with others.
